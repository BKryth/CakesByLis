						<a class = "accordion-link" href="#question1" style="text-decoration: none;">
							What is the price of a cake?
							<ion-icon name="caret-down-outline"></ion-icon>
							<ion-icon name="caret-up-outline"></ion-icon>
						</a>
						<div class = "answer">
							The price of custom-made wedding or other celebration cake depends on several factors, among them: 
							the number and sizes of cake tiers,  the intricacy of the cake design/decoration, and cake flavor.  
							I am providing you with our current price list showing the indicative prices based on different cake sizes. I can give you a proper price quote once you give us your desired cake specifications and design pegs. 
							We can also help you with the design of your cake.
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="accordion-item" id="question2">
						<a class = "accordion-link" href="#question2" style="text-decoration: none;">
							How do I place a cake order?
							<ion-icon name="caret-down-outline"></ion-icon>
							<ion-icon name="caret-up-outline"></ion-icon>
						</a>
							<div class = "answer">
							Please fill up the Order/Contract form provided to you. After we have finalized the details, 
							and signed the Order/Contract Form,  we will book your order as soon as you have paid the required 5% nonrefundable deposit which forms part of the cake price.
							</div>
					</div>
					<div class="accordion-item" id="question3">
						<a class = "accordion-link" href="#question3" style="text-decoration: none;">
							How do I make my payment? Do you require a deposit?
							<ion-icon name="caret-down-outline"></ion-icon>
							<ion-icon name="caret-up-outline"></ion-icon>
						</a>
						<div class = "answer">
							As indicated in the Order/Contract Form which we will execute, we will book your order upon your  payment of a 5% nonrefundible deposit. 
							The balance should be paid no later than 3 days before cake pick-up (for single-tier cakes); and at least 1-week before pick-up/delivery of multilayered cakes. 
							The 5% deposit assures you of a slot in our calendar of orders. Payments can be made to our specified GCash or Bank Accounts.
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="accordion-item" id="question4">
						<a class = "accordion-link" href="#question4" style="text-decoration: none;">
							How many days advance notice do you require for cake orders.
							<ion-icon name="caret-down-outline"></ion-icon>
							<ion-icon name="caret-up-outline"></ion-icon>
						</a>
						<div class = "answer">
							We can take only a limited number of orders a week, so we advice you to place your order soon after you have set the date for your special occasion. 
							Provided your desired date is still open (in our cake order calendar), we require at least a week's notice (confirmed order) for single-layer cake and a month for multi-tier cakes.
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="accordion-item" id="question5">
						<a class = "accordion-link" href="#question5" style="text-decoration: none;">
							Do you deliver to areas outside of Metro Manila? How much is the delivery fee?
							<ion-icon name="caret-down-outline"></ion-icon>
							<ion-icon name="caret-up-outline"></ion-icon>
						</a>
						<div class = "answer">
							Yes, we can deliver to nearby cities outside MM, but only for multilayer cakes. We charge a minimal delivery fee depending on the distance of the celebration venue from our place in Manila. 
							Single-tier cakes, however, are only for pick-up.
						</div>

					<div class="accordion-item" id="question6">
						<a class = "accordion-link" href="#question6" style="text-decoration: none;">
							What cake flavors do you offer?
							<ion-icon name="caret-down-outline"></ion-icon>
							<ion-icon name="caret-up-outline"></ion-icon>
						</a>
						<div class = "answer">
							Some of the favorite flavors ordered from us are Carrot-Walnut, Citrus Poundcake (w/ glazed fruits & walnuts), Chocofudge-Caramel, Banana-Cashew and Coffee-Caramel Poundcake but we also make other flavors preferred by clients. 
							Each cake tier can be a different flavor.
